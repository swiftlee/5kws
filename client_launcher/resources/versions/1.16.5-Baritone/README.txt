Before installing, make sure that you have Vanilla 1.16.5 installed. You must run this version at least once beforehand!

Installation (Windows)

 1. Open up "Run" (WIN+R)
 2. Type "%APPDATA%"
 3. Press "Ok"
 4. Open the folder ".minecraft"
 5. Drag+Drop this "1.16.5-Baritone" folder into "versions". Do NOT drag+drop just the json file, it must be this entire folder.
 6. Launch Minecraft
 7. Create a new profile using the "1.16.5-Baritone" version (it will not create one for you sadly)
 8. Launch the profile, and you're done!

Installation (OSX & Linux)

Do the same as on windows, but instead of dragging the folder into "%APPDATA%/.minecraft/versions", drag it to the equivalent location for your OS.
 - On OSX this is "~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/versions"
 - On Linux this is "~/.minecraft/versions"

1.16.5-Baritone has no .jar, only a .json. It will work nevertheless.
