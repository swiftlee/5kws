# Logging into multiple accounts simulatenously

1. Sign in each account manually via your Minecraft launcher.
2. Add the username of each account to the `accounts.txt` file, separating each by a new line.
3. Run `start.bat` or `start.sh` depending on your system. If you are using a Unix based system (MacOS or Linux) run the `.sh`. For Windows, use the `.bat` file.

> This will begin everything for you, this includes installing the modified 1.16.5 version of Baritone in your mods folder before it boots the launcher.
